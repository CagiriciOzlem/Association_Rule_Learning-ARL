# Association_Rule_Learning-ARL

In today's world where the number of customers and transactions are increasing, it has become much more valuable to create meaningful results from data and for developing strategies. Revealing hidden patterns in the data in order to be able to compete better and maximize profit in the face of intense competition in the market, and to establish value-oriented long-term relationships with customers, makes a great contribution to determining marketing strategies.
However, although the development of rule-based strategies is no longer possible in the big data world, offering the right product to the right customer at the right time; It forms the basis of cross-selling and loyalty programs within the scope of customer retention and increasing lifetime value. At the same time, companies can make product offers and develop effective marketing strategies by using these patterns of association.
Market Basket analysis is one of the association rule applications. It allows us to predict the products that customers tend to buy in the future by developing a pattern from their past behavior and habits. There are different algorithms to be used for Association Rules Analysis. One of them is the Apriori algorithm. In this project, product association analysis will be handled with “Apriori Algorithm” and the most suitable product offers will be made for the customer who is in the sales process, using the sales data of an e-commerce company.
